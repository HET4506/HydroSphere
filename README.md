# Green Hydrogen Infrastructure Mapping & Optimization  
---

## 1. Motivation  
The energy sector is undergoing a global shift toward cleaner and more sustainable solutions. Fossil fuels are environmentally destructive and economically unstable due to import dependencies and volatile prices.  

Green hydrogen, produced via electrolysis powered by renewable energy, provides a clean, scalable, and secure alternative. India, with its vast solar and wind resources, is uniquely positioned to lead this transition.  

However, one of the biggest barriers is not the technology itself but **identifying the best-suited regions for green hydrogen production**. This requires a data-driven infrastructure mapping system that accounts for renewable energy potential, water resources, industrial demand, and logistical feasibility.

## 2. Problem Statement  
Despite global investments in hydrogen, a fundamental challenge persists:  
**Where should we set up hydrogen production hubs to maximize efficiency, minimize costs, and accelerate adoption?**  

Without accurate mapping and optimization, projects may suffer from:  
- Misplaced investments.  
- High production and distribution costs.  
- Uneven industrial adoption.  

Our solution focuses on creating an **interactive, data-driven platform** that identifies the **top 5 best-suited cities in India** for green hydrogen hubs and explains the rationale behind their selection.

## 3. Why This Problem Matters  

- **Economic Impact**  
  - Correct site selection lowers CAPEX and OPEX for hydrogen projects.  
  - Attracts global investment by showcasing India’s hydrogen-readiness.  

- **Industrial Impact**  
  - Steel, cement, refineries, and transportation sectors can adopt hydrogen faster.  
  - Reduces dependence on fossil fuels, driving industrial competitiveness.  

- **Environmental Impact**  
  - Optimized sites align production with renewable-rich areas.  
  - Reduces emissions while ensuring sustainable water resource management.
